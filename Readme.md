# Snap Report API  - Getting Started

> **Note**
>
> As you may already know, the [WinForms Snap control](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/11373/controls-and-libraries/snap) and [Snap Report API](https://docs.devexpress.com/OfficeFileAPI/15188/snap-report-api) are now in maintenance support mode. No new features or capabilities are incorporated into these products. We recommend that you use [DevExpress Reporting](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/2162/reporting) tool to generate, edit, print, and export your business reports/documents.


The following code demonstrates how to generate a simple tabular report using Snap Report API.<br>After running this example, a console application creates an <strong>RTFÂ </strong>fileÂ and opensÂ it in the default application registered for this file type.<br>For further information, refer to the Snap Report API and Getting Started documentation articles.Â
